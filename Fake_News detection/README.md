## Description about repository:
This repository consists of Natural_language_Learning Projects. Datasets are provided and also the solution to the problem statements have been provided.

## Fake News Classification
1. The project involved textual analysis of news articles to detect Fake News. Performed tokenization by using Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and created a corpus.
2. Using TFIDF Vectorizer as the feature description of the text, designed a Multinomial Naive Bayes model. 
3. Accuracy score of 90%, Precision Score of 94% was achieved after tuning multinomial Naive Bayes model using hyperparameters.

### Tools:
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. NLTK
4. Matplotlib
5. TFidf Vectorizer
6. Multinomial Naive Bayes Classification Algorithm
7. Google Colab
